# Tic-Tac-Toe_Game
Certainly! Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game played between two players, usually termed as "X" and "O", who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
